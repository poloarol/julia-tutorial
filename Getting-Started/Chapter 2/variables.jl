# 5 basic data types
# Integers, Floating point numbers, booleans, strings and characters

# Variable names typically are lowercase. Use underscore uf the name
# is too long to be easily read.

second = 2.0
stringvar = "This is a string"
initial = 'J'

println(first)
println(second)
println(stringvar)

# Variables can be re-defined
# Strings and characters are different
